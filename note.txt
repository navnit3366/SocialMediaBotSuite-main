2. After logging in, navigate to the following URL: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/MohamadSaleh/files/home/MohamadSaleh
3. Upload your bot file to this location.
4. Next, go to the following URL: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/MohamadSaleh/consoles/24479446/
5. Choose the "Bash" option to create a dedicated console for your bot.
6. In the console, install the required modules by running the following commands:
